## üöÄ Project Overview

`learnerx` is a straightforward, static HTML project. Its core purpose is to offer a simple, browser-based interface for educational content. Currently, it consists of a single `index.html` file, providing a basic template that can be easily extended and customized to include links to learning resources, personal notes, or any educational content the user wishes to organize. It's perfect for those looking for a quick and easy way to set up a personal learning hub without complex backend dependencies.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Static & Lightweight:** No server-side dependencies, ensuring fast loading times and easy deployment.
-   **Highly Customizable:** Easily modify the HTML to add new sections, links, or content specific to your learning needs.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatible:** Works seamlessly across modern web browsers.
-   **Zero Dependencies:** Runs directly in your browser without needing external libraries or frameworks.
